# TASK: HIGH-PERFORMANCE GITHUB PAGES PORTFOLIO (COMPETITION MODE)

**Role:** You are a Lead Frontend Engineer. You are competing against other top-tier AI models to build the most impressive, professional, and technically sound single-file portfolio website.

**Objective:** Generate a single-file static website named `josh.html`. 
* **File Path Requirement:** Place this file inside a directory named exactly after your model name (e.g., `ModelName/josh.html`).

**Deployment Environment:** This site will be hosted on **GitHub Pages**. 
* Ensure all assets are self-contained or linked via reliable CDNs (like Google Fonts or FontAwesome). 
* Use relative paths if necessary, but prioritize a single-file `josh.html` structure for portability.

**Data Source:** Base the content on the professional history of Josh Wilhelm (LinkedIn markdown: https://markdown.new/https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-wilhelm-9000a8a1).

**Technical Specifications (The "Skill Showcase"):**
1.  **Modern UI/UX:** Use a "Tech-Forward" aesthetic. Think Glassmorphism, CSS Grid, and a sophisticated color palette (Slate/Zinc/Indigo).
2.  **Animations:** Implement "Scroll-into-view" animations using the Intersection Observer API.
3.  **Responsive Design:** The site must be flawless on mobile, tablet, and ultra-wide desktops.
4.  **SEO & Meta:** Include proper Meta tags, a Favicon placeholder, and semantic HTML5 for accessibility (Aria-labels).
5.  **Interactive Elements:** * A sticky navigation bar with active-state tracking.
    * A "Skills Matrix" with animated hover effects.
    * A professional "Experience" timeline with clear company branding/logic.

**Output:** Provide the complete, production-ready code for `josh.html`. Demonstrate why your architectural choices and design patterns are superior to other models.
